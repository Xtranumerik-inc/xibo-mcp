### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Geographic zone configuration format changed from Quebec-specific to generic regions

### üöÄ Migration from v2.0.0
1. Update your `.env` file geographic zones:
   ```diff
   - GEO_ZONES='{"quebec_region":["Quebec City"],"montreal_region":["Montreal"]}'

   ```

2. Update any hardcoded Quebec references in your configurations to generic regions
